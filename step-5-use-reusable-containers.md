# Step 5: Use Reusable containers

During the development, you will keep changing the code and verify the behavior either by running the tests 
or running the application locally. Recreating the containers for every code change might slow down 
your quick feedback cycle. One technique that you can apply to speed up testing and 
local development is using the reusable containers experimental feature.

Since you are using the Testcontainers Desktop, the `testcontainers.reuse.enable` flag is set automatically 
for your dev environment. 
You can enable or disable it by clicking on **Enable reusable containers** option under Preferences.

When the reuse feature is enabled, you only need to configure which containers should be reused using the Testcontainers API. While using Testcontainers for Java you can achieve this using .withReuse(true) as follows:

```java
@TestConfiguration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
public class ContainersConfig {

    @Bean
    @ServiceConnection
    PostgreSQLContainer<?> postgresContainer() {
        return new PostgreSQLContainer<>(parse("postgres:16-alpine")).withReuse(true);
    }
    
    //Similarly add .withReuse(true) for other containers
    
}
```

When you first start the application, the containers will be created. 
When you stop the application, the containers will continue to run. 
When you restart the application again, the containers will be reused.

If you no longer want to keep the containers running, then you can remove them by clicking on Testcontainers Desktop â†’ Terminate containers.
